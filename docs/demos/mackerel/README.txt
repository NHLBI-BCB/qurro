This Qurro visualization was produced by a later version of Qurro (a demo
version of v0.3.0). See
https://github.com/knightlab-analyses/qurro-mackerel-analysis -- the Jupyter
notebook in this repository shows how this visualization was generated.

Also, if you'd like, the qurro-plot.qzv file in this repository should work in
view.qiime2.org (and contains provenance from the notebook).
