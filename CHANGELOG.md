# Qurro changelog

## Qurro 0.1.1 (in development)
### Features added
- The color schemes used in the sample plot are now modifiable! All of the
  color schemes described
  [in the Vega documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/), as of
  writing, should be usable.
  ([#158](https://github.com/fedarko/qurro/issues/158))

- Feature loading names (in Qurro plots produced from DEICODE biplots) are now
  clearer: instead of being labelled `0`, `1`, `2`, etc., the loadings are now
  labelled `Axis 1`, `Axis 2`, `Axis 3`, etc.
  ([#145](https://github.com/fedarko/qurro/issues/145))
### Backward-incompatible changes
### Bug fixes
### Performance enhancements
### Miscellaneous 
- Added citation instructions and some small documentation fixes to the README
- Fixed a typo in the license (forgot to update this when we renamed the tool
  to "Qurro" a few weeks ago)
- Cleaned up some of Qurro's basic documentation (in its `setup.py`, etc.).

## Qurro 0.1.0 (June 25, 2019)
- Released the first version of Qurro [on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qurro/)!
