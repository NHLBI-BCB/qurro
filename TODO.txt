*1. Filter samples with infinity/-infinity/NaN balances out of scatterplot
   entirely. Currently they're mapped to a constant value, which is a terrible
   thing to preserve.
    This might necessitate recreating the entire sample plot from scratch with
    certain samples withheld, or calling .remove() in Vega or something.
    That's worth it, though, IMO.

*2. Fix bug in the Malassezia/Propionibacterium thing? just compare divergent
   points in worst case. probably something dumb.

4. If either the numerator or denominator's text field (from the multi
   selections) are empty, handle it accordingly: JS treats "" as being in
   every string, so uh gotta figure out a workaround. Just checking if
   the trimmed input is "" -- and if so, giving the user an error -- should be
   sufficient.

5. Ensure this works when the user cancels an action to do something else.
   e.g. they click to select a numerator in the rank plot, then do stuff with
   the multi selection stuff, then click to select a denominator in the rank
   plot. I think this works ok now, but double check. Probably good to add
   test case(s) for this especially.

6. Add option to clear select microbes file without reloading the page.

7. Revise code to not say "genera" (due to how viruses kinda mess with the
   notion of taxonomic classes in this case). Just "rank" should be fine.

8. In filterTaxa...(), make the microbe column start point (24) be stored as
   an attribute somewhere in the JSON file. This will make this function
   flexible for datasets with more or less metadata for samples.
