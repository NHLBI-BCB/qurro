function changeSamplePlotToBoxplot() {
    set color encoding type to nominal, and field to whatever x-axis field is
    remove tooltip encoding
    set mark = boxplot
    hide color input elements (add "invisible" to their classLists)
    remakeSamplePlot();
}

function changeSamplePlotFromBoxplot(toQuantitative) {
    set mark = circle
    add back tooltip encoding (done automatically)
    set color encoding to whatever inputs say (just call updateSamplePlotField('color')
        and updateSamplePlotScale('color') but don't remake the sample plot there -- make
        a new parameter for that)
    unhide color input elements
    if (toQuantitative) {
        Change the sample plot x-axis scale type encoding, and remove the
            x-axis encoding. It's probably easiest to just abstract out the
            relevant parts of updateSamplePlotScale("xAxis") to another
            function that does this, so that we can call it from here as well
            as inside updateSamplePlotScale().
    }
    remakeSamplePlot();
}

WHEN CHECKING BOXPLOT BOX

if (sample plot x-axis is currently categorical)
    changeSamplePlotToBoxplot();

WHEN UNCHECKING BOXPLOT BOX

if (sample plot x-axis is currently categorical)
    changeSamplePlotFromBoxplot();

WHEN CHANGING SAMPLE PLOT X-AXIS SCALE TYPE

if (going to quantitative, and boxplot is checked)
    changeSamplePlotFromBoxplot(true);
if (going to categorical, and boxplot is checked)
    changeSamplePlotToBoxplot();

OLD STUFF BELOW; above is the stuff i have planned
=======================
WHEN GOING TO A BOXPLOT

set color encoding to nominal + field = (whatever the x-axis is)
remove tooltip encoding
set mark = boxplot
hide the color inputs elements

WHEN GOING FROM BOXPLOT

set mark = circle
add back tooltip encoding (should be done automatically)
unhide inputs
set color encoding to whatever the inputs currently are.
