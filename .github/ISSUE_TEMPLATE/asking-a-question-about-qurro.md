Thanks for using Qurro!

**If you're using Qurro through QIIME 2,** we recommend asking your question on the QIIME 2 forums, in particular on the "Community Plugin Support" category at https://forum.qiime2.org/c/community-plugin-support/24.

**If you're using Qurro outside of QIIME 2,** you can still ask your question on the QIIME 2 forums, but we ask that you instead use the "Other Bioinformatics Tools" category at https://forum.qiime2.org/c/other-bioinformatics-tools/17.

**In either of these cases,** you're welcome to ask your question here on GitHub instead (but please only post in one of these three places, not in all of them :). We'll try to answer your question, with the important caveat that we can't *guarantee* support (the primary developers of this software are grad students).

Thanks!
